      <p>On Sunday October the 11th, I rode my Ridley cyclocross bike up the John Wayne Pioneer Trail. I started just outside of Issaquah and rode through the old train tunnel. This was approximately 25 miles of trail.</p>

      <p>About 10 miles into the return trip, I somehow lost control of my bike. This resulted in me going ass over teakettle and hurting myself pretty good.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, I was not alone and my co-rider was able to ride ahead and bring back the car to a trail junction that was close to where I crashed.</p>
      <p>I was taken to the Swedish Medical Center in Issaquah. My injuries included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Concussion</li>
          <li>Fractured ribs</li>
          <li>Strained shoulder muscles</li>
          <li>Strained back muscles</li>
          <li>Bruised foot</li>
          <li>And I also managed to catch a cold during the hour wait for the car</li>
        </ul>
      <p>I own four bikes and have ridden for many years. In the back of my mind, I knew I was lucky to not have had a serious accident up to this point. There were several close calls over the years, but I came out clean each time. Well, reversion to the mean caught up with me and I had a rough Sunday.</p>
      <p>Compounding the issue, it is difficult for me to type, making the creation of an HTML page for my homework difficult. I've kept the page simple as a result.</p>
